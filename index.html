				<h2>Our History</h2>
				<p>“We Real Cool” is the poem so many of us know from grade school: the Seven (that sacred number of the seeker, the thinker, the mysterious) at the Golden Shovel (the shovel be golden but be ready to dig your grave). Them lounging streetcornerwise in
					our consciousness under some flickered neon of mannish-boy dream. A Chicago/Detroit/Harlem/St. Louis/L.A./Gary/... corner. Someplace where the rhyme is always as good as the reason, anyplace where the cost of gin is precious enough to thin but solemn
					enough to pour on the sidewalk for the departed, anyplace where the schools are overcrowded and underfunded and black and brown enough to not really miss the Seven, who were underperforming on the standardized tests and had been diagnosed as ADD
					or BDD status anyway.</p>

				<p>Atsuko Toko Fish retired as a U.S.-Japan cross-cultural consultant, and is currently involved with various social innovative movements as a philanthropist. She is also a trustee of the Fish Family Foundation. In the wake of 3.11, Atsuko established
					the Japanese Disaster Relief Fund – Boston (JDRFB) with The Boston Foundation (TBF) and the Japan Society Boston (JSB) to support immediate and mid-term recovery in the affected regions of Tohoku. Atsuko visited Tohoku several times after the disaster
					to assessed and evaluated the needs of the people and community. In the two years the fund was active for, JDRFB raised approximately $1 million and distributed 24 grants to 19 organizations and projects working directly in Tohoku. It has been reported
					by the grantees that JDRFB’s $1 million grants were leveraged to have $6 million of economic impact. </p>

					<h2>FISH FAMILY FOUNDATION</h2>
					<p>Atsuko enthusiastically described her passion to support and empower female leaders in Japan at “Fish Family Foundation & The Nippon Foundation CANPAN・NPO Forum” happened on December 6th in Tokyo, Japan. Atsuko gave a lecture on what role family
						foundations play in the U.S. society. Additionally, she gave a powerful talk on how she expects female leaders in Japan to bring positive social changes to brighten the Japanese society. Furthermore, the 2017 JWLI Fellows shared how they are going
						to use the lessons they learned during their stay in Boston to make their Action Plans come true. Together with Atsuko and the 2017 JWLI Fellows, the participants of the event completed worksheets for describing the problems they are seeing in Japan
						and brainstormed what
						<actio></actio>ns they can make to fix it.</p>

					<p>On October 6th, JWLI hosted its 10th Anniversary Reception at Simon College in Boston to celebrate its ten-year efforts in empowering Japanese women and making difference in Japan. Two JWLI alumnae, Tomoe Yamada and Kiyono Yagami, shared the impacts
						they made in Japan through achieving their Action Plans. They spoke candidly about their experience in Boston and achievements in Japan since then. Listening to the powerful and emotional speeches by Kiyono and Tomoe, the audience of over 100 people
						learned the continued needs of more participation by women leaders in the Japanese social sector. JWLI Founder, Atsuko Fish, and JWLI’s academic partner, Patricia Deyton of Simmons College, both thanked a number of community partners and host organizations
						that contributed to JWLI’s success. They also highlighted some of the Fellows’ successes. The event also included a graduation ceremony of the 2016 Fellows. Over the past 10 years, so many individuals and organizations supported JWLI. Without them,
						JWLI would not have made it to the 10th year. Thank you so much!</p>
